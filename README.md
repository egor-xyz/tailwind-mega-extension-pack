Make your Visual Studio Code the best IDE for the Tailwind framework

## Includes

- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Tailwind Docs
- Tailwind Fold
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Auto Close Tag
- Auto Rename Tag

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions. **Front-End Mega Extension Pack**

Visual Studio Code Marketplace: [Front-End Mega Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=egor-xyz.tailwind-mega-extension-pack)

Can also be installed in VS Code: Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

### Sort class names

I recommend to use [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) for class names sorting

```shell
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

This plugin follows Prettier’s auto loading convention, so as long as you’ve got Prettier set up in your project, it’ll start working automatically as soon as it’s installed.

```shell
ext install egor-xyz.tailwind-mega-extension-pack
```
